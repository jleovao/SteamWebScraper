# SteamWebScraper

This is a personal project I developed while learning Python. When executed, this Python script will extract data from Steam, which is a digital distribution platform developed by Valve Corporation. I use this data to display the top selling products and its information from the Steam market. The extracted data is then parsed and saved into a csv file for future references.
